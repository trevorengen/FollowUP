# FollowUP

Its a pretty basic tool I've created for my sales job.
I just wanted to practice python and SQLite3 on a basic project
that I saw all the way to the end before stepping into something 
more advance. Do what you want with it but if it hasn't been 
touched in a few months don't expect me to ever touch it again.
